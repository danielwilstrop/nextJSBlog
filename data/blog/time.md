## Wheres my free time gone!

What a crazy week. Six days back in the kitchen, a minimum of 11 hours a day and it's finally come to an end. It not that I haven't enjoyed cooking for non-covid restricted weddings again as I have but I had almost forgotten after such a long time on furlough how physically and mentally draining it could be. This week has well and truly been one of those weeks as we all get back into the rhythm of our day jobs again. Having two chefs with me both new to the role hasn't helped matters but after the seven weddings we have cooked this week we are getting somewhere as a team and I can imagine a time in a few weeks where we will be finding it a little easier once more but for now, its been a very hard week.

Taking my day job into account I am beginning to realise how difficult studying a degree around a job that demands more than a usual amount of hours is going to be. I got a couple of hour study done on Friday, and around an hour twice in the week on breaks from work but in the longer term that's not going to be sustainable if I'm going to achieve the goals I have set myself. I need a long, hard think about managing my time as when you add family time into the mix too there just not enough hours in the day currently.

I have two days off coming? I intend to fill with a lot of studies but again do I really wish to work five days and then study the two days I am off? I cant see that being enjoyable or rewarding as time goes on as regardless of future aspirations, everyone needs downtime to relax and enjoy their busy lives.

The work from the open university currently has moved on to networking and some mathematics which luckily I am picking up and understanding fairly easily but at level 2 and beyond I very much doubt this will be the case and I will need to ensure I'm finding the time to study effectively.

Maybe I'm just tired, aching, miserable, having a moan and all will be well. Whilst that is the most likely scenario knowing what I'm like, I still need to plan accordingly as this past week has been incredibly tough.

On the bright side, it does look like it is coming home, so perhaps every cloud does have a silver lining after all.
