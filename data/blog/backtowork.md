## From coding to cooking!?..

Tomorrow morning I am back at work properly, for the first time since February 2020. I was on a family holiday pre-covid, I had to self isolate myself as it all started in the UK and as we went into lockdown I was placed on furlough. Fourteen months off work is a long time for anyone so I'm unsure how to feel. No one has enjoyed the pandemic, and no one has enjoyed the financial hit of furlough, but as someone who likes to be as positive a possible, it hasn't been all bad. I've spent a lot of time I wouldn't otherwise have had with my two young daughters, my garden looks like it's ready for the Chelsea flower show and I've had a new lease of life regarding my future career. Not too bad at all in hindsight.

Will I enjoy being back? I'm sure I will do, I do of course love to cook and tomorrows wedding breakfast is stuffed and roasted whole suckling pigs which are great. I will be back with the team who are all good friends I haven't seen in person for a long time and of course ill is earning my full salary which is always nice.

When I first started learning to programme and when I enrolled with the Open University people were sceptical. Was it on a whim? was it just boredom from lockdown? will I just coom forever, drop out of uni and put it all behind me? These are all things that have crossed my mind also but the biggest bit of anxiety I have about returning isn't the hard work, it isn't the long days, it is losing the spare time to sit with my mac, switch the world off and write some code. To me, this tells me this was the right choice and despite time now being a luxury, not something I have in abundance, I'm more determined than ever to study hard, learn well and get my new career off to its best possible start when the time is right.
