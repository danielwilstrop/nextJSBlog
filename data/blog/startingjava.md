# To Java or not to Java

I have come to a little bit of a natural end with my progress towards a new career at the moment. I've done many a javascript/react project and believe I have that concreted in my head to a pretty decent standard. I have put a lot of time into my degree lately and as a result have my second major assignment sealed and ready to go 6 weeks early, which I am quite happy about. I could read more into the topics discussed in the latest block of my course but I feel I've taken from it what was needed and I'm ready to move on.

This has also coincided with furlough coming to an end and getting back to work full time from the start of next month.

The conundrum I had was what to do now? Should I just endlessly make websites and web apps? Learn a new language? Take a break whilst getting back into the swing of full-time work?

Originally I thought I would study c# and delve into the world of .net and Unity, then I was convinced learning swift was the way to go, then I debated being a little off the beaten track and picking up something like f#. In the end, all I know is web dev and if I am to learn a more traditional language and the principles of OOP I eventually decided that there wasn't a better option than Java. It is well supported, there is a lot of information about it, it's a general use language and it will teach me all I need to know.

Codecademy is booted up, Udemy course purchased, many videos downloaded and the next few weeks will be spent learning something new as well as being finally back to full-time work next month. It is going to be a tough and busy summer but at the end of it ill be 1/2th way through my degree, will have learnt Java and more than likely remembered why I want to leave catering so much.
