## Should I do this?

My coding journey began during the covid lockdowns of 2020. I was furloughed, I was bored, I was broke. What else was there to do other than drink wine and eat overly inudulgent food and takeaways on a daily basis? After doing just that for a couple of months I decided that I needed something else to fill the days and thought I would make a website as it was always something I had fancied doing and now I had the time at last. A year later and im studying a degree, have several published projects and I am facinated by the world of coding, and am fully committed to changing my caeer.

A little background first, I have done nothing other than cook for a living (from pubs to fine dining) for my enitre life so this is quite a radical decision. On the one hand I love food, I love cooking and I love the camaraderie that comes with the environemnt. On the other hand I really do not enjoy the hours, the physical toll it takes on your body and the sometimes dreadful working conditions.

We could go as far as listing some pros and cons of my current career:

| Pros | Cons                    |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
|      | Long Hours              |
|      | Physically Draining     |
|      | Poor working conditions |
|      | No family time          |

Other than loving food and cooking I couldn't think of another positive whilst writing that short list. As a head chef now, the financial hit of changing careers will certianly be hard on myself and my family but with commitment, hard work and discipline the lower pay wont be forever and Im confident I can make my new career a success. I asked should I do this? I think until the day I accept my first dev position I will continue to ask myself that and worry im making a mistake. The first time I sit in my new office, with my pleasant surroundings and colleaugues and I sip a coffee whilst typing my first professional code will be the first time I can answer that question.
