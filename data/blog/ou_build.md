### Scratch Programming

As part of my first Open University module there is a whole block based on what they call OUBuild. It is a direct clone of MIT Scratch ([Found here](https://scratch.mit.edu/)). It is essentially a drag and drop system to teach children how to code and the principles behind it. From someone who has learnt some languages to a minor extent I was a little dubious to say the least, what possible use would making a cartoon cat dance on the screen have to my learning and development?

As the picture shows it is literally english writing in little coloured blocks that you drag and drop into place to create a 'programme' that can do a variety of things. There is a full assesment on this topic worth 30% of the total module mark so I took a deep breath, opened the software and thought "Lets get this over with".

How incredibly wrong I was! If you take the childish exterior away and this is truly a great piece of software for any total begginer to learn the fundamentals of coding with. I mean no one is going to launch a moon rocket, create a website or develop the next call of duty with it but it really is fantastic. The whole software is based on sprites, which are effectively images that you can add your code to to move them, make them talk, change their looks and more. They can also 'talk' to each other to make the programme more complex fi you choose to.

There are variables, initilisation, lists, if/else statements, loops, movement based on _x_/_y_ values and you can make your own functions. All the core basics of programing are there, just packaged with nice colours, english not syntax and a very easy to use a UI.

All in all my mindset towards scratch has changed a lot after using it, and you really should never judge a book by its cover. As someone with a little experience of the subject I imagine I will breeze through this part of my study but for total begginers or keen children/teenagers it really is a great place to start a coding journey.
