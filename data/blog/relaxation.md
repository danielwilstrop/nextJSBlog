### Coding is the new chilling?

Having gone back to work recently and cooked a lot of food, for a lot of (unfortunately small) weddings I have never wanted to change my career more. The heat, the work itself and the hours are just getting too much. If it wasn’t for my fantastic colleagues who I actaully enjoy spending my days with, I would have been close to just calling it a day over the last week.

Coding is my relaxation, on an evening I’m learning, I’m studying, I’m building and I know that every minute, hour and day I spend is bringing me that but closer to the dream job I’m hoping to get in a couple of years time.

“Coding is my relaxation” is a strange term, as whilst building my current project in react I’ve encountered nothing but stress with it. Problem after problem that I have needed to fix that to some would be tedious, some would give up, some would hate it. But I thrive on solving those issues and I guess that’s why I believe I will make a good developer one day for the business that takes that chance and employs me.

Solving problems in coding is another strange one as sometimes you know exactly what you want to do but need to find a way to achieve that with the syntax and tools you have been provided with and I’m realising more and more that the internet memes are actually true! Coding isn’t just writing code but you also need to be a thorough researcher, be a pro at using Google search and have the ability to locate relevant information quickly and efficiently. I feel this is another skill that my time with the OU will help me develop too.
