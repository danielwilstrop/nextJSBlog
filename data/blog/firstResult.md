# First Tutor Marked OU Results

Today was a great day (working bank holiday Monday aside), as I received my first result back from the Open University. My tutor gave me a very pleasing 95%.

There was some constructive criticism regarding the most basic of errors such as spelling mistakes, and continuity errors which I am kicking myself over but overall I am more than thrilled with the result and It spurred me on to get stuck back into the course and push on for a similar or better result in my next TMA (Tutor Marked Assignment).

I have a bad habit already on my study journey of rushing through things, where there isn't any need to at all given the timeframes and general nature of the Open University which is more than likely why I made the simple mistakes I did so a new goal is to slow down and take my time. The next assignment is not due until 15th July so I have plenty of time to ensure its accuracy, well presented and can hopefully meet the high benchmark I have set myself!
