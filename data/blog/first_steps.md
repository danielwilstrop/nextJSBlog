summary: Taking my first steps on a long journey with the Open Univeristy
---

Its been a long time since i've studied anything at all, I left school 16 years ago with my GCSE's and even then I didnt particuarly study very well. I was significantly more interested in messing around with the 'lads', smoking behind the gym building and playing football than actually doing any schoolwork. Fast forward to adulthood and its amazing how much things can chnage. I now want to learn, I want to study, I want to be academic and no one is as surprised as me by this revelation. As part of my career chnage and coding journey I realised that I would need some qualifications and having a young family means a brick univeristy was out of the question so I started endless research into the Open Univeristy and settled on their degree course, Bsc Computing and IT.

The OU is really great, I partuculary like the modular structure of the course so to some extent you can pick and choose what information and direction you go down througout your study which is excellent. The first module is compulsoary however and is titled TM111 - Introduction to Computing and IT. I got myself enrolled, sorted out the student finance and waited what felt like an eternity for the course to begin and the materials to arrive. Then one rainly day in March the friendly DPD driver not only had (another) package of clothes for my wife but the box I had been waiting for.

On first impressions the materials provided are really excellent, well written books, a module website with forums and online activities to aid you in your study, plenty of support from fellow students and a tutor who you are free to contact for help, advice and support. On further inspection I became slightly disheartened as the content of the course was incredibly basic. I realise this is an introduction module but a little more depth of the topics covered would have been a little more engaging. The module is split into three blocks.

1. The Digital World
2. Creating Solutions
3. Connecting People, Places and Things

The first of these blocks had a wide variety of topics from Binary to Databases, from malware to web design. I cant say I learnt particularly much but its getting me back into the swing of regular study so I do appreciate the gentle start. Im awaiting my results of my first submitted asingment as I write this.

Block 2 is a whole module on programming, excellent I thought!.....It uses Scratch by MIT, repackaged for the Open University. Should be a bit of fun but perhaps some real programming would be better, time will tell in this regard

Block 3 covers the Internet, the Internet of Things and networking/communications. From a first glance this looks a little heavier and is in a lot more depth so im looking forward very much to getting my teeth stuck into that one later in the year.

All in all its going well, I was beyond anxious about starting but now ive got going its been fun, i'm going to be fine and my initial fear is beggining to fade. Ive 'met', totally virtually on whatsapp, some great people on the course which helps with discussions and removes the isolation of distance learning completely. Its almost like the pub at a brick uni, just without the cheap beer. Once this intro course is done there some really meaty modules to get stuck into over the next few years and from my experince so far I think ill enjoy every minute of it.
